                        <p class="card-text">Like a mountain, a plateau is higher than its surrounding area. However plateaus have a flat top, while mountains have peaks. Like mountains, 
                            plateaus are formed when two continental plates collide, but erosion due to wind and water flattens the top. Plateaus are not as tall as 
                        mountains. In fact, some plateaus, such as the Tibetan Plateau, lie between two mountains ranges.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">A valley is a low-lying area of land that is usually found at the foot of mountains or hills. The most common way valleys are formed 
                            is by erosion of land from running water. River valleys are formed by the action of river. As the river flows downhill, it cuts through the land like a knife. 
                        Over thousands of years the river erodes the land to form a valley, usually in the shape of a 'V'. In contrast, valleys formed by glaciers are often U-shaped, 
                        because they are formed by rocks carried in the glacier that erode the soil.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">A deep valley with cliffs on both sides is called a canyon. Sometimes a large river may run through a canyon. The Grand Canyon in Arizona, 
                            USA is the world's largest canyon. It was formed by the Colorado River. Millions of years ago, this region was covvered by sea. Slowly, a part of the sea 
                            floor was pushed up to form a plateau. Over the years, rainwater collected to form a river. This river cut into the rocks on the plateau to form the canyon.

                        <p class="card-text">Caves or huge holes under the ground in cliffs or under the sea. Caves can be formed in many ways. Most rock caves, especially limestone caves, 
                            are formed by rainwater that seeps into tiny cracks in the rocks. The rainwater contains minerals and chemicals that slowly causes the rock to dissolve, leaving 
                            behind a large hole. This may take several thousand, or even a few million years.

                        <p class="card-text">Sea caves are formed by waves that wear away the rocks at the base of a cliff. These rocks are usually very weak and have tiny cracks in them. 
                            The continuous pounding of the waves causes the tiny cracks to widen and soon the rocks began to crumble and form small hollows. These hollows keep expanding 
                            as sand, gravel and rocks brought by the waves erode their inner walls. Some sea caves are submerged during high tide and can only be seen when the water goes 
                            down at low tides.<p>

                        <p class="card-text">A rift valley is created when two tectonic plates pull away from each other, leaving a low space in the middle. The Great Rift Valley is the 
                            best known rift valley in the world. It covers a distance over 6,000 kilometres <em>(3,700 miles)</em>, stretching from north Syria in West Asia to central 
                            Mozambique in East Africa. It began to form about 35 million years ago, when the African and Arabian tectonic plates began to pull apart. Even today it is 
                            still growing, as East Africa slowly sperates from the rest of Africa.<p>
